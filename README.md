## Project Description
This is project 1 of 5 of freeCodeCamp's *Responsive Web Design Certificate* curriculum. The objetive is to build an app that passes The goal of the project is to build an app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNqgVx.

The finished project is meant to be submitted via a CodePen link, but I believe it to be good practice to practive coding in a repository. It's also good to keep practice files for different tutorials/projects in one place.
