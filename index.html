        <h2>A Brief Timeline of Carl Sagan&#39s Life</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1934</strong> - Carl Sagan was born in Brooklyn, New York. His father was an immigrant garment worker. His mother a housewife.</li>
          <li><strong>1947</strong> - The year that inaugurated the "flying saucer" craze, Carl Sagan as a child suspected the "discs" might be alien spaceships.</li>
          <li><strong>1949</strong> - His family moved to the Rahway, New Jersey. He graduated High School in 1951, and was the president of the school's chemistry club.</li>
          <li><strong>1954</strong> - He graduated with honors from the University of Chicago, one of the few universities to admit a 16-year-old.</li>
          <li><strong>1956</strong> - He earned a M.S. degree in physics, eventually earning a  Ph.D. degree in 1960 with his thesis Physical Studies of Planets</li>
          <li><strong>1958</strong> - He worked on classified military Project A119, the secret Air Force plan to detonate a nuclear warhead on the Moon.</li>
          <li><strong>1960</strong> - Sagan was a Miller Fellow at the University of California, Berkeley and also worked with NASA's Mariner 2 team.</li>
          <li><strong>1968</strong> - Sagan was denied tenure at Harvard. The tenure denial has been blamed on several factors, including that he focused his interests too broadly across a number of areas.</li>
          <li><strong>1972</strong> - Sagan assembled the first physical messages sent into space: the Pioneer plaque and the Voyager Golden Record, universal messages that could potentially be understood by any extraterrestrial intelligence that might find them.</li>
          <li><strong>1976</strong> - Held the position of David Duncan Professor of Astronomy and Space Sciences at Cornel (till his passing).</li>
          <li><strong>1980</strong> - Narrated and co-wrote the award-winning 1980 television series Cosmos: A Personal Voyage. The most widely watched series in the history of American public television, Cosmos has been seen by at least 500 million people across 60 different countries.</li>
          <li><strong>1985</strong> - Published the science fiction novel Contact, the basis for a 1997 film of the same name.</li>
          <li><strong>1989</strong> - Interviewed by Ted Turner. When asked whether he believed in socialism he responded: "I'm not sure what a socialist is. But I believe the government has a responsibility to care for the people... making the people self-reliant."</li>
          <li><strong>1996</strong> - After suffering from myelodysplasia for two years and receiving three bone marrow transplants from his sister, Sagan died from pneumonia at the age of 62.</li>
