            <h3>A Brief Timeline of Carl Sagan’s Life</h3>
            <!-- LIST -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1934</strong> - Carl Sagan was born in Brooklyn, New York. His father was an immigrant garment worker. His mother a housewife.</li>
                <li><strong>1947</strong> - The year that inaugurated the "flying saucer" craze, Carl Sagan as a child suspected the "discs" might be alien spaceships.</li>
                <li><strong>1949</strong> - His family moved to the Rahway, New Jersey. He graduated High School in 1951, and was the president of the school's chemistry club.</li>
                <li><strong>1954</strong> - He graduated with honors from the University of Chicago, one of the few universities to admit a 16-year-old.</li>
                <li><strong>1956</strong> - He earned a M.S. degree in physics, eventually earning a  Ph.D. degree in 1960 with his thesis Physical Studies of Planets</li>
                <li><strong>1958</strong> - He worked on classified military Project A119, the secret Air Force plan to detonate a nuclear warhead on the Moon.</li>
                <li><strong>1960</strong> - Sagan was a Miller Fellow at the University of California, Berkeley and also worked with NASA's Mariner 2 team.</li>
                <li><strong>1968</strong> - Sagan was denied tenure at Harvard. The tenure denial has been blamed on several factors, including that he focused his interests too broadly across a number of areas.</li>
                <li><strong>1972</strong> - Sagan assembled the first physical messages sent into space: the Pioneer plaque and the Voyager Golden Record, universal messages that could potentially be understood by any extraterrestrial intelligence that might find them.</li>
                <li><strong>1976</strong> - Held the position of David Duncan Professor of Astronomy and Space Sciences at Cornel (till his passing).</li>
                <li><strong>1980</strong> - Narrated and co-wrote the award-winning 1980 television series Cosmos: A Personal Voyage. The most widely watched series in the history of American public television, Cosmos has been seen by at least 500 million people across 60 different countries.</li>
                <li><strong>1985</strong> - Published the science fiction novel Contact, the basis for a 1997 film of the same name.</li>
                <li><strong>1989</strong> - Interviewed by Ted Turner. When asked whether he believed in socialism he responded: "I'm not sure what a socialist is. But I believe the government has a responsibility to care for the people... making the people self-reliant."</li>
                <li><strong>1996</strong> - After suffering from myelodysplasia for two years and receiving three bone marrow transplants from his sister, Sagan died from pneumonia at the age of 62.</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>
                <cite>“No one has ever explained space, in all its bewildering glory, as well as Sagan did. He’s been gone now for nearly two decades, but people old enough to remember him will easily be able to summon his voice, his fondness for the word “billions” and his boyish enthusiasm for understanding the universe we’re so lucky to live in.”</cite>
                <p>-- Joel Achenbach | Smithsonian Magazine (2014)</p>
